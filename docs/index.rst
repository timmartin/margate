Introduction
------------

Margate is a templating engine for Python that compiles templates down
to Python bytecode. It is mostly Django-compatible in spirit, though
it falls short of being a drop-in replacement for Django templates.

Early performance testing suggests that it is around 10 times faster
than regular Django templates.
